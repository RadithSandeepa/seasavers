# SeaSavers

In a time when environmental conservation is more crucial than ever, having a dedicated platform to coordinate and promote coastal cleanup efforts is invaluable. The Coastal Cleanup Coordination System (CCCS) developed by our project team, SeaSavers, provides a seamless and effective way for community members, tourists, and local businesses to participate in and organize coastal cleanups. By aligning with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) No. 14, our platform plays a key role in conserving and sustainably using ocean and marine resources.
